## 🐳 Docker Deployment Guide

The application uses a unified `docker-compose.yml` that seamlessly supports both Local Development and AWS EC2 environments natively, thanks to host networking.

### Local Development (Physical Database)
When running locally, the application connects to the MySQL instance physically installed on your machine.
1. Ensure your `.env` has `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev`
2. Start the application:
   ```sh
   make docker-up
   ```
*Note: Because `docker-compose.yml` uses `network_mode: "host"`, the container's `localhost` perfectly maps to your physical machine's `localhost`. It will securely connect to your physical MySQL database without requiring any OS-level `bind-address` config changes.*

### Production (AWS EC2 & RDS)
When running in production on EC2, the application connects to a remote AWS RDS instance.
1. Ensure your `.env` has `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod` and the correct `DB_URL` pointing to your RDS instance.
2. Start the application:
   ```sh
   make docker-up
   ```
*Note: `network_mode: "host"` behaves exactly like port mapping (`-p 9090:9090`) in EC2, directly exposing the application on port 9090 to the internet/load balancer while securely communicating with RDS over the VPC.*
